## Recomended approach

Start small and build pieces of your project incrementally. 

Start out by creating your project's foundation in HTML. After that, save your work by making a commit in git.

From here, build one piece of Javascript functionality at a time, testing each change you make with `console.log`. Frequently make commmits in git to save your progress.
