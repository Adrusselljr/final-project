# Final Project

MEMORY CARD GAME

My final project is my version of the card game Memory.  First you select your difficulty, then you start clicking away trying to match pairs.  Be careful not to click too much or else you'll run out of try's and reset the board!  Match all the pairs to win the game!  Good Luck!

FEATURES
1.  Displaying a board of cards created through javaScript, based on the level of difficulty selected.
2.  Allow user to click on a card to reveal the face value.
3.  After two card are revealed, then they're checked to see if they match or not.
4.  A click count in place to make the game more challenging
